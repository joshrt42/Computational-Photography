Read me! BNW_to_RGB.pde

1) Generate 3 black and white images, each representing one color channel of an image (red, green, blue). Alternatively, look to the "channel images" folder and move 3 of the matching ones found there to the "bnw_to_rgb" folder.

2) With those 3 images in the "bnw_to_rgb" folder, rename them to "red.JPG" "green.JPG" and "blue.JPG" baed on the color channel they each represent.

3) Open and run bnw_to_rgb.pde using Processing.

4) Modify and save composite image as desired.
